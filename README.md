# Anketa_PTO_gino

The questionnaire can be used to predict the degree of risk of pelvic organ prolapse (PTO) in women. Risk factors are determined with an assessment in points. The points obtained are summed up, after which a forecast of low, medium and high degrees of risk of PT is carried out. The method provides an increase in the accuracy of the prediction of PTO due to a more complete account of modifiable, unmodifiable and potentially modifiable risk factors.
